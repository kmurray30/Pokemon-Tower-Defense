# Pokemon-Tower-Defense
Pokemon Tower defense game where you control the wild pokemon to prevent trainers from reaching the gym. Defeat trainers to buy new pokemon in infinite waves!

Simply run jar file

Click on grass to place turret. Price is $100 but increases by $50 with each turret you buy.

Every level there is one more trainer and their health increases. Health is denoted by number of pokeballs (bc you are trying to defeat all their pokemon!)

Money increases slowly over time and you get a bonus whenever you defeat a trainer. Money can buy turrets and also new pokemon!

Buying a new pokemon gives a random chance that they will appear from bushes. The more expensive the pokemon, the more damage it will do to trainers.

Have fun!
